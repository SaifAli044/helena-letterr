                        <strong>Dear Helena.</strong>
                        <p>
                         I'm not exactly sure on how to start this. I've never really been good with these sort of things,
                            but theres a few things i want you to know. I know you think that im forgetful of you but youd be surpiresd to know 
                            how much you're in both my mind and heart. I love to hear about your day and all the little things that happened and i hope i 
                            always get to hear about your day. The way your face lights up when you smile makes my day. You make the world feel a little bit kinder
                            and give me the energy i need to keep going. I wish i could take away all that hurts you. I hope you never forget that you are everything that makes this world good! You're beautiful from the inside and it shows in everything you do. Thanks for holding on when its easier to let go
                            You mean the world to me
                            From saif
